# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application
### Rails 4.0.2

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

As per course instruction, this app is being built with minimal bells and whistles.
All styling is being skipped, cucumber will not be implemented, work will only
progress through chapter 9 (Updating, showing, and deleting users).
