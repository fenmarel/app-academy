##Music Inventory

The goal of this app is to give users a place to keep track of the music that
they own.  Features include: self rolled user auth, activation emails,
user sessions, and all around basic Rails functionality.  Again, we have not started doing any styling or css, so I have just thrown in bootstrap and
a few minor css additions.
