## Command Line Twitter Client

Very basic command line app using Twitter's API to create a simple CLI.
Able to post, fetch tweets, store tweets/users, lookup stored values.

Check out the lib folder and the models for the meat of the project.

Also, all of my private keys should have been ignored by git, if you find one, please let me know :)
